Azure Stream Analytics Manager
==============================

This service allows to manage the Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) jobs,
to set the configuration, start, stop, and monitor their status.

The service uses the information manage by PCS Telemetry microservice
to set the stream processing logic, in order to implement monitoring
rules applied to the telemetry generated by IoT Devices.

ASA jobs use a reference table, in order to support device grouping,
i.e. to define monitoring rules on a group of devices. The device
groups are managed by PCS Configuration, using Azure IoT Hub device
twin queries.
