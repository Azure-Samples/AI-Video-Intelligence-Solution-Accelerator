Tokens
==========

## What is a JWT?

 A [JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://jwt.io/) is a compact, URL-safe means of transferring
 information that contains JSON objects encoded and serialized for transmission.

## How is this used?
We can get user information like name and roles values from the JWT token. In this
implementation, we use [Azure AAD tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims).

The claims are added to the AAD application manifest so that the token contains the desired information.
You can learn more about optional token claims [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-claims-mapping).

We can also get access token for resources by using application's credential so that Azure resource management task can be performed. The current user who has the role which includes 'AcquireToken' will be able to get this token.
