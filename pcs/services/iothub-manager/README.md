# IoTHub Manager Overview

This service manages most of Azure IoT Hub interactions, such as creating and managing IoT devices, device twins, invoking methods, managing IoT credentials, etc. This service is also used to run queries to retrieve devices belonging to a particular group (defined by the user).

The microservice provides a RESTful endpoint to manage devices, device twins, commands, methods and all the Azure IoT Hub features required by the [Azure IoT Remote Monitoring](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet) project.

## Why?

This microservice was built as part of the [Azure IoT Remote Monitoring](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet) project to provide a generic implementation for an end-to-end IoT solution. More information [here][rm-arch-url].

## Features

* Device creation in IoT Hub
* Read for all devices
* Read for a single device
* Query for set of devices
* Update devices
* Delete devices
* Schedule jobs
    * Execute methods
    * Update the device twin
* Get a list of jobs
* Get a single job

# How to use

## Running the service with Docker

You can run the microservice and its dependencies using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
with the instructions [here][run-with-docker-url].

## Running the service locally

## Prerequisites

### 1. Deploy Azure Services

This service has a dependency on the following Azure resources. Follow the instructions
for [Deploy the Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy-local#deploy-the-azure-services) to deploy the required resources.

* [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/)

### 2. Setup Dependencies

This service depends on the [Storage Adapter microservice](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-storage-adapter-dotnet). Run the Storage Adapter microservice using the the instructions in the Storage Adapter service [README.md](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-storage-adapter-dotnet/blob/master/README.md).

* [Storage Adapter microservice](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-storage-adapter-dotnet)

> Note: you can also use a [deployed endpoint][deploy-rm] with [Authentication disabled][disable-auth] (e.g. https://{your-resource-group}.azurewebsites.net/storageadapter/v1)

### 3. Environment variables required to run the service
In order to run the service, some environment variables need to be created
at least once. See specific instructions for IDE or command line setup below for
more information. More information on environment variables
[here](#configuration-and-environment-variables).

* `PCS_AUTH_WEBSERVICE_URL` = http://localhost:9001/v1
    * The url for the [Authentication service](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-auth-dotnet) from [Setup Dependencies](#setup-dependencies)
* `PCS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING` = {your Azure IoT Hub connection string from [Deploy Azure Services](#deploy-azure-services)}
    *  More information on where to find your IoT Hub connection string [here][iothub-connstring-blog].
* `PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_WEBSERVICE_URL` = http://localhost:9022/v1
    * The url for the [Storage Adapter service](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-storage-adapter-dotnet) from [Setup Dependencies](#setup-dependencies)

## Running the service with Visual Studio or VS Code

1. Make sure the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) are set up.
1. [Install .NET Core 2.x][dotnet-install]
1. Install any recent edition of Visual Studio (Windows/MacOS) or Visual
   Studio Code (Windows/MacOS/Linux).
   * If you already have Visual Studio installed, then ensure you have
   [.NET Core Tools for Visual Studio 2017][dotnetcore-tools-url]
   installed (Windows only).
   * If you already have VS Code installed, then ensure you have the [C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)][omnisharp-url] extension installed.
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code
1. Define the following environment variables. See [Configuration and Environment variables](#configuration-and-environment-variables) for detailed information for setting these for your enviroment.
   1. `PCS_AUTH_WEBSERVICE_URL` = {authentication service endpoint}
   1. `PCS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING` = {your Azure IoT Hub connection string}
   1. `PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_WEBSERVICE_URL` = {storage adapter service endpoint}
1. Start the WebService project (e.g. press F5).
1. Using an HTTP client like [Postman][postman-url],
   use the [RESTful API][project-wiki] to test out the service.

## Running the service from the command line

1. Make sure the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) are set up.
1. Set the following environment variables in your system. More information on environment variables [here](#configuration-and-environment-variables).
    1. `PCS_AUTH_WEBSERVICE_URL` = {authentication service endpoint}
    1. `PCS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING` = {your Azure IoT Hub connection string}
    1. `PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_WEBSERVICE_URL` = {storage adapter service endpoint}
1. Use the scripts in the [scripts](scripts) folder for many frequent tasks:

* `build`: compile all the projects and run the tests.
* `compile`: compile all the projects.
* `run`: compile the projects and run the service. This will prompt for
  elevated privileges in Windows to run the web service.

## Project Structure

This microservice contains the following projects:
* **WebService.csproj** - C# web service exposing REST interface for storage
functionality
* **WebService.Test.csproj** - Unit tests for web services functionality
* **Services.csproj** - C# assembly containining business logic for interacting 
with Azure Cosmos account with type SQL
* **Services.Test.csproj** - Unit tests for services functionality
* **Solution/scripts** - Contains build scripts, docker container creation scripts, 
and scripts for running the microservice from the command line

## Updating the Docker image

The `scripts` folder includes a [docker](scripts/docker) subfolder with the files
required to package the service into a Docker image:

* `Dockerfile`: docker images specifications
* `build`: build a Docker container and store the image in the local registry
* `run`: run the Docker container from the image stored in the local registry
* `content`: a folder with files copied into the image, including the entry point script

# Configuration and Environment variables

The service configuration is accessed via ASP.NET Core configuration
adapters, and stored in [appsettings.ini](WebService/appsettings.ini).
The INI format allows to store values in a readable format, with comments.

The configuration also supports references to environment variables, e.g. to
import credentials and network details. Environment variables are not
mandatory though, you can for example edit appsettings.ini and write
credentials directly in the file. Just be careful not sharing the changes,
e.g. sending a Pull Request or checking in the changes in git.

The configuration file in the repository references some environment
variables that need to be defined. Depending on the OS and the IDE used,
there are several ways to manage environment variables.

1. If you're using Visual Studio (Windows/MacOS), the environment
   variables are loaded from the project settings. Right click on WebService,
   and select Options/Properties, and find the section with the list of env
   vars. See [WebService/Properties/launchSettings.json](WebService/Properties/launchSettings.json).
1. Visual Studio Code (Windows/MacOS/Linux) loads the environment variables from
   [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json)
1. When running the service **with Docker** or **from the command line**, the
   application will inherit environment variables values from the system. 
   * [This page][windows-envvars-howto-url] describes how to setup env vars
     in Windows. We suggest to edit and execute once the
     [env-vars-setup.cmd](scripts/env-vars-setup.cmd) script included in the
     repository. The settings will persist across terminal sessions and reboots.
   * For Linux and MacOS, we suggest to edit and execute
     [env-vars-setup](scripts/env-vars-setup) each time, before starting the
     service. Depending on OS and terminal, there are ways to persist values
     globally, for more information these pages should help:
